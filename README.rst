===================================
My emacs configuration (deprecated)
===================================

This configuration served me well for many years, but I have
transitioned to a much simpler setup
(https://github.com/nhoffman/emacs-config). I'm leaving this here for
(my own) historical interest

The html-exported version of init.el is available here:
http://nhoffman.github.io/.emacs.d/

Requires emacs 24.1+ and org-mode 8+

License

This repository contains code obtained from other sources. Hopefully I
have given credit where credit is due and complied with everyone's
licensing requirements. Please open an issue if any code hasn't been
properly attributed.

Installation
============

The repository is intended to be cloned directly into one's home
directory, where emacs will see it. Most dependencies are provided by
the amazing ELPA. After cloning the repository, launch emacs, and then
execute ``M-x install-packages``. See init.org for complete
instructions.
